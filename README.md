Display disk usage in the terminal using treemaps

Given a path on your hard-drive (which could also be the root path, eg. `/`). `diskonaut` scans it and indexes its
metadata to memory so that you can explore its contents (even while still scanning).

Once completed, you can navigate through subfolders, getting a visual treemap representation of what's taking up your
disk space. You can delete files or folders as well and `diskonaut` will track how much space you've freed up in this
session.

## Install

Install with cargo or download the latest version from the GitHub Releases. Note that the precompiled binaries are
optimized for small binary size (see `.goreleaser.yaml` for how exactly).

```sh
cargo install diskonaut-x
```

## Usage

To scan the current folder run:

```sh
diskonaut
```

You can specify any folder to scan:

```sh
diskonaut ~
```

To show file sizes rather than block usage on disk run `diskonaut -a`. To skip delete confirmation run `diskonaut -d`
